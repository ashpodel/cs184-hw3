    <h1>Ramu ki Raamkahaani</h1>
    <h2>The Conundrum</h2>
    <section>
          <p>Ramu was a little boy who grew up in the small town of Pune.</p>
	      <p>When Ramu was young, his favorite superhero was Shaktimaan.</p>
	          <p>Shaktiman used to say, </p>
		      <blockquote>with great power comes great responsibility.</blockquote>
		          <p>Ramu had only 3 burning desires, in no particular order</p>
			      <ul>
				<li>Hear Shaktimaan say the aforesaid line in person</li>
				<li>Get a photo clicked with Shaktimaan</li>
				<li>Become his sidekick.</li>
				    </ul>
			          <p>Before he could this, he had to however achieve a certain set of things in a particular order. These were:</p>
				      <ol>
					<li>Find a criminal event in the city <em>ahead of time</em>, something that would cause Shaktimaan to come and save the parties involved.</li>
					<li>Be at that criminal event.</li>
					<li>Help Shaktimaan in a critical step.</li>
					<li>Ask him to be his sidekick.</li>
					    </ol>

      <h2>The Fixer</h2>
      <p>Clearly, achieving the above would be probabalistically impossible, a little bit like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">monkeys writing all of Shakespeare works hypothesis</a>, so he had to come up with an alternate plan.</p>
      <p>That's when he knew he had to call Moe.</p>
      <p>Moe wasn't the Moe from Simpsons, though he did use the Simpsons Moe as his avatar. <br/>This was the image he used:</p>
      <p><img src="http://thegazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/MoeSzyslak1.gif" width="100"/></p>
      <p>Ramu had met Moe randomly on the interwebs and unlikely though it is to become friends with someone whose real identity is unrevealed, Ramu and Moe had become pretty good friends. But then again the internet allowed people to be who they wanted to be, unencumbered by their physical body or the family and society they came from.</p>
      <p>Over time, Ramu had realized that Moe was also a fixer. He could get <strong>things</strong> done.</p>
      <p>So, Ramu opened his favorite IM client, and as expected, found Moe online. Moe was always online.</p>
      <pre>
	Ramu: Moe, I need your help.<br/>
	Moe: Again?<br/>
	Ramu: I'll owe you big time. I need to stage a criminal event that will invite Shaktimaan's attention.<br/>
	Moe: Consider it done. I'll send you the details in an hour.
	</pre>
      <p>That was a bit too easy, Ramu started wondering if something else was up. Whatever it may be, Ramu was willing to face the consequences for a shot at being Shaktimaan's sidekick.</p>

      <h2>The Plan</h2>
      <p>Just as Moe had promised, Ramu had a blinking email in his inbox.</p>
